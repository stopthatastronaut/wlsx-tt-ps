# WLSX-TT-PS

A PowerSHell Azure function that addresses a tech test

## Why PowerShell?

I initially started the response in F# (see [wslx-tt](https://github.com/stopthatastronaut/wlsx-tt)) however I lost a fair chunk of time dealing with dependency issues and DLL hell. Switching to a PowerShell Azure Function allowed me to avoid the dependency aspect and focus instead on the code itself.
